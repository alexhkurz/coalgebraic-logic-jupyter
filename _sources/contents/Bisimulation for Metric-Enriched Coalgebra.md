#  FML: Bisimulation for Metric-Enriched Coalgebra

(under construction)

This follows on from [Bisimulation for Order-Enriched Coalgebras](https://hackmd.io/V6m2cAy_TdagteE4RG_sbw).

## Introduction

The question I want to pose here is the following.

If a bisimulation in the ordered setting is the kernel (via pullback or comma) of the unique morpism into the final coalgebra, what is the analogous construction in the enriched setting.

Recall that in the quantale-enriched setting a category, such as a Lawvere-metric space, can equivalently be presented as a relational presheaf (uniformity). 

Let $f:X\to Z$ be the morphism to the final coalgebra. Then the largest bisimulation on $X$ is given by the Lawvere-metric  given by $R(x,x')=Z(fx,fx')$.

Is there a universal way to construct $R$ as a limit involving $f$?
