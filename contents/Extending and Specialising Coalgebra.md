# Extending and Specialising Coalgebra

(under construction ... [index](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/Hy1oUrS4u))

One strand of research in coalgebraic logic is axiomatic. ... 

The part that can be developed over an arbitrary base category is coincides with algebra over an arbitrary base category. ...

## Coalgebras over Sets

This is one reason why coalgebras over sets play a particularly important role. 

Another is that the notion of bisimulation as a relation on states needs a base category that is set based. 

Yet another reason is that, historically, the theory of coalgebras arose from research in domain theory. In fact, ... (Aczel, Rutten, Jacobs, ...) ...
